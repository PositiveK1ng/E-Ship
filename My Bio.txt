Hello, my name is Ibrahm Manirabizi
and I am completing an A1 degree in
Information Technology at IPRC Kicukiro 
with a minor in Computer Skills.

I am interested in a career in
Management in the field of Human
Resources.
At Coe, I am involved in Student
Council and Peer Advising. This has
helped me develop skills in
leadership and teamwork.
I have also had an internship
position as a Human Resources
intern with a local company and
discovered that I really enjoy
creating events and coordinating
activities for employees.
I would be interested in job
shadowing at your company. Could
you recommend someone for me to
contact?
